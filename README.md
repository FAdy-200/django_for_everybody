# Django for Everybody SPECIALIZATION

This repository contains files and resources that I'm using while studying the Django for Everybody SPECIALIZATION on Coursera. The specialization consists of four courses:

- Web Applications for Everybody
- Building Web Applications in Django
- Django Features and Libraries
- Using JavaScript, JQuery, and JSON in Django

Each of these courses covers various topics related to developing web applications using the Django framework.

This repository contains the following files and directories:

- **Course Notes**: This directory contains notes and summaries of the course material, including important concepts and code examples.

- **Assignments**: This directory contains the assignments for each course in the specialization, along with my solutions to these assignments.

- **Projects**: This directory contains the projects I've worked on while studying the specialization, including the final capstone project.

- **Resources**: This directory contains any additional resources that I've found helpful while studying the specialization, such as books, articles, and blog posts.
