# Django for Everybody SPECIALIZATION

This repository contains files and resources that I'm using while studying the Django for Everybody SPECIALIZATION on Coursera. The specialization consists of four courses:

- Web Applications for Everybody
- Building Web Applications in Django
- Django Features and Libraries
- Using JavaScript, JQuery, and JSON in Django

Each of these courses covers various topics related to developing web applications using the Django framework.

## Contents

This repository contains the following files and directories:

- **Assignments**: This directory contains the assignments for each course in the specialization, along with my solutions to these assignments.

- **Resources**: This directory contains any additional resources that I've found helpful while studying the specialization, such as books, articles, blog posts and cheat sheets.

## Getting Started

To use these files and resources, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/FAdy-200/django_for_everybody.git```

Once you've cloned the repository, you can access the course notes, assignments, projects, and resources directly from your local machine.

## Requirements

To work with these files and resources, you'll need to have Python and some libraries installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the libraries using using pip:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
